 This vignette introduces the use of the package TRESS 
 (${\it T}$oobox for m${\it R}$NA ${\it E}$pigenetics 
 ${\it S}$equencing analysi${\it S}$), 
 which is designed for analysis of MeRIP-seq data. 
 It provides functionalities for m6A methylation identification 
 and differential m6A methylation identification.
 TRESS utilizes Bayesian hierarchical negative 
 binomial models to extract signals in raw read counts, 
 and then conducts Wald tests to detect m6A methylation 
 and differential methylation.

# Introduction 
## Background
The post-transcriptional epigenetic modiﬁcation on mRNA is an 
emerging ﬁeld to study the gene regulatory mechanism and 
their association with diseases. Recently developed 
high-throughput sequencing technology named 
Methylated RNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (MeRIP-seq) 
enables one to proﬁle mRNA epigenetic modiﬁcation transcriptome-wide. 

In MeRIP-seq, mRNA is first fragmented into approximately 
100-nucleotide-long oligonucleotides, and then 
immunoprecipitated by an anti-m$^6$A affinity purified antibody. 
In addition to the immunoprecipitated (IP) samples, 
libraries are also prepared for input control 
fragments to measure the corresponding reference mRNA abundance. 
This process is an RNA-seq experiment.
After sequencing, the reads from both the IP and the input 
samples are aligned to the reference genome. 
Due to the enrichment from IP process, 
transcriptomic regions with m$^6$A will 
have more reads clustered and have peak-like shapes 
when visualizing the read counts along the genome. 
Therefore, people often refer the m$^6$A regions as "peaks", 
which is a term usually used in ChIP-seq to represent the 
protein binding sites. Figure \@ref(fig:m6aPeak) shows some example 
peaks on the Fat2 gene from a dataset to study m$^6$A dynamics 
during mouse brain development, where m$^6$A in cerebellums 
from 2-week old mice are profiled with two biological replicates. 

```{r m6aPeak, echo=FALSE, out.height = "80%", out.width = "80%", include=TRUE,fig.cap="Peaks from MeRIP-seq in a mouse brain study"}
knitr::include_graphics("m6APeak.png")
```

Two major tasks in the analysis of MeRIP-seq data are to 
identify transcriptome-wide m$^6$A methylation (namely "peak calling"), 
and differential m6A methylation. 


For the first problem, TRESS builds a two-step procedure to 
identify transcriptome wide m$^6$A regions. In the first step, 
it quickly scans the whole transcriptome and losely identify 
candidate regions using an ad hoc algorithm. In the second step, 
it models read counts from candidate regions using an 
empirical hierarchical negative binomial model to accounts 
for all-sources variations. It also imposes a prior on 
the dispersion of methylation, which induces a shrinkage 
variance estimate by borrowing information from all 
candidate regions. Wald test is constructed to detect 
significant m$^6$A regions from the candidates.
For the second problem, TRESS constructs a general linear 
framework based on hierarchical negative binomial model, 
to connect methylation level of each region with factors 
of interest. This characteristic makes TRESS applicable 
not only for two-group comparisons, 
but also in studies with complex design.

# Input data preparation{#section:InputData}
## Peak calling
TRESS requires paired 
input control and IP BAM files for each replicate of all samples: 
"input1.bam \& ip1.bam", "input2.bam \& ip2.bam", .... in order to call peaks from all replicates.
The BAM files contain mapped reads sequenced from 
respective samples and are the output of sequence alignment tools 
like ``Bowtie2``. 

For illustration purpose, we include four example BAM files and one corresponding genome annotation file in our publicly available data package ``datasetTRES``on github, 
which can be installed with
```{r, eval= FALSE}
install_github("https://github.com/ZhenxingGuo0015/datasetTRES")
```
The BAM files contain sequencing reads (only on chromosome 19) 
from two input \& IP mouse brain cerebellum samples.

In addition to BAM files, TRESS also needs a path to 
an annotation file in order to obtain transcriptome-wide bins, 
bin-level read counts and annotation of each peak. 
The annotation file is actually is a TXDB and is saved in 
format of ``*.sqlite``, which is easily created using R function 
``makeTxDbFromUCSC()`` from Bioconductor package ``GenomicFeatures``:
```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## Directly use "makeTxDbFromUCSC" function to create one
library(GenomicFeatures)
txdb = makeTxDbFromUCSC("mm9", "knownGene")
# saveDb(txdb, file = paste0("YourPATH", "/", "YourGenome.sqlite")

## or load a TxDb annotation package like
# library(TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm9.knownGene)
# txdb <- TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm9.knownGene
# saveDb(txdb, file = paste0("YourPATH", "/", "mm9_knownGene.sqlite")
```

## Differential peak calling
**Model fitting:**
Similar to peak calling, differential peak calling in TRESS
also needs BAM files and corresponding genome annotation 
file saved in ``*.sqlite`` format.
However, to compare methylation level 
across different conditions, paired input \& IP BAM files 
for samples of all conditions are required. 
Also, the input order of BAM files from 
different conditions should be appropriately 
listed in case that samples from different conditions 
are mistakenly treated as one group.


As TRESS is designed for differential analysis under 
general experimental design, then sample 
attributes determined by all factors in study should also be 
provided to construct a design matrix. 
For this, TRESS requires a dataframe containing, 
for each factor, the attribute value of all samples (the 
order of sample should be exactly the same as BAM files
taken by TRESS). 
A particular model determining which factor will be 
included into design matrix should also be provided.


 **Hypothesis testing:**
All aforementioned input requirements 
are for model fitting in TRESS.
For hypothesis testing, TRESS requires a contrast of 
coefficients.
The contrast should be in line with the name and order of all
coefficients in the design matrix. 
It can be a vector for 
simple linear relationship detection 
or a matrix for composite relationship detection.


# Example dataset {#section:EData}
TRESS provides three example MeRIP-seq dataset.
The raw sequencing reads of all three data were downloaded 
from GEO, and mapped using ``Bowtie2`` to generate 
corresponding BAM files. 
With BAM files, we apply TRESS to obtain transcriptome 
bins and candidate regions. A small subset of both bin-level 
and region-level data are stored as examples in 
TRESS for package illustration purpose.


The first example dataset ``Basal`` comes from 7 basal 
mouse brain samples (GEO accession number GSE113781). 
The total number of bins and candidate regions for 
original data are 1,620,977 and 13,017 respectively.
Due to space limit, 
only data of randomly selected 1000 bins and 
500 regions (bins and regions are not necessarily overlapped) 
are saved. In particular, 
for each bin and candidate region, 
both the genomic coordinate and read counts 
(across 7 paired input \& ip replicates) are kept.
 
```{r loadData,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(TRESS)
data("Basal")
Bins <- Basal$Bins$Bins
BinCounts <- Basal$Bins$Counts
dim(BinCounts)
Candidates <- Basal$Candidates$Regions
CandidatesCounts <- Basal$Candidates$Counts
sf <- Basal$Bins$sf
```

Check the coordinates of each bin and candidate region. 
```{r BasalBins}
head(Bins, 3) 
head(Candidates, 3)
```

Check the read counts in each bin and candidate region. 
```{r BasalCount}
dim(BinCounts)
head(BinCounts, 3)
dim(CandidatesCounts)
head(CandidatesCounts,3)
```
Check the library size factor of each sample in this data. 
```{r Basalsf}
sf
```


The second example dataset ``DMR_M3vsWT`` comes from human
Hela cell lines (GEO46705).
This dataset contains samples from two conditions: 
wild type (WT) and METTL3-Knockout (M3-KO).
Each sample contains two input \& ip replicates. 
For comparison between original M3-KO and WT samples, 
TRESS called 10841 candidate DMRs, 
but data (genomic coordinates and read counts matrix) 
for only 200 randomly selected candidate DMRs are kept. 
Library size factor for each sample is also saved.
In addition to 200 candidate DMRs, 
data for 737 bins overlapping with 6 example candidate 
DMRs are also included for visualization purpose.

```{r loadDataM3}
data("DMR_M3vsWT")
Candidates <- DMR_M3vsWT$Regions
CandidatesCounts <- DMR_M3vsWT$Counts
sf <- DMR_M3vsWT$sf

### bins overlapping with 6 candidates
bins <- DMR_M3vsWT$Bins
```

Check the coordidates of candidate DMRs between WT and M3-KO samples.
```{r CheckCanM3}
dim(Candidates)
head(Candidates, 3) 
```

Check the read counts in candidate DMRs between WT and M3-KO samples.
```{r CheckDataM3}
dim(CandidatesCounts)
head(CandidatesCounts, 3)
```

Check the library size factor of each sample.
```{r ChecksfM3}
sf
```

Check the overlapps between bins and candidate DMRs.
```{r CheckOverlapM3,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(GenomicRanges)
bins.GR <- GRanges(Rle(bins$chr), IRanges(bins$start, bins$end), 
                   Rle(bins$strand))
Candidates.GR <- GRanges(Rle(Candidates$chr), 
                         IRanges(Candidates$start, Candidates$end), 
                   Rle(Candidates$strand))
library(GenomicFeatures)
sum(countOverlaps(Candidates.GR, bins.GR) > 0)
```


The third example dataset ``DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek`` 
comes from mouse brain samples (GEO144032). 
It consists of samples from mouse brain cortex and 
hypothalamus regions at two time points, 2- and 6-week-old. 
Each sample contains two paired input and ip replicates. 
we focus on differential methylation between 
2- and 6-week-old samples in each brain region. 
A total of 15,724 candidate DMRs are called by 
TRESS and only 200 randomly selected candidate DMRs are kept.
Library size factor for each sample is also saved. In addition, 
methylation ratio of 200 candidate DMRs in each sample are also 
included to provide an intuitive comparison of methylation level
in samples of different conditions.

```{r loadDataTime}
data("DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek")
Candidates <- DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$Regions
CandidatesCounts <- DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$Counts
sf <- DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$sf
```

Check coordidates of candidate DMRs between six and two week samples.
```{r CheckCanTime}
dim(Candidates)
head(Candidates, 3) 
```

Check read counts in candidate DMRs between six and two week samples.
```{r CheckDataTime}
dim(CandidatesCounts)
head(CandidatesCounts, 3)
```

Check the library size factor of each sample.
```{r ChecksfTime}
sf
```
Check methylation ratio of 200 candidate DMRs across all samples.
```{r CheckRatioTime}
MeRatio <- DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$MeRatio
head(MeRatio, 3)
```

# Detection of transcriptome wide peaks {#section:Peak}
Peak calling in TRESS is performed using one wrapper function 
``TRESS_peak()``. Here we use example BAM files from datasetTRES
as an example.
```{r, eval= FALSE,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Directly take BAM files in "datasetTRES" available on github
library(datasetTRES)
Input.file = c("cb_input_rep1_chr19.bam", "cb_input_rep2_chr19.bam")
IP.file = c("cb_ip_rep1_chr19.bam", "cb_ip_rep2_chr19.bam")
BamDir = file.path(system.file(package = "datasetTRES"), "extdata/")
annoDir = file.path(system.file(package = "datasetTRES"),
                    "extdata/mm9_chr19_knownGene.sqlite")
OutDir = "/directory/to/output"  
TRESS_peak(IP.file = IP.file,
           Input.file = Input.file,
           Path_To_AnnoSqlite = annoDir,
           InputDir = BamDir,
           OutputDir = OutDir, # specify a directory for output
           experiment_name = "examplebyBam", # name your output 
           filetype = "bam")
```
```{r, eval= FALSE}
### example peaks
peaks = read.table(file.path(system.file(package = "TRESS"),
                           "extdata/examplebyBam_peaks.xls"),
                 sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
head(peaks[, -c(5, 14, 15)], 3)
```

To replace the example BAM files with your BAM files, the codes are:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
## or, take BAM files from your path
Input.file = c("input_rep1.bam", "input_rep2.bam")
IP.file = c("ip_rep1.bam", "ip_rep2.bam")
BamDir = "/directory/to/BAMfile"
annoDir = "/path/to/xxx.sqlite"
OutDir = "/directory/to/output"
TRESS_peak(IP.file = IP.file,
           Input.file = Input.file,
           Path_To_AnnoSqlite = annoDir,
           InputDir = BamDir,
           OutputDir = OutDir,
           experiment_name = "xxx",
           filetype = "bam")
peaks = read.table(paste0(OutDir, "/", 
                          "xxx_peaks.xls"), 
                   sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
head(peaks, 3)
```

As a wrapper function, ``TRESS_peak()`` combines multiple subfunctions to 
detect m6A regions transcriptome-wide. 
 The whole process involves following steps:
 
$\quad 1$. Divide genome into equal sized bins and obtain read counts in each replicate using 
  ``DivideBins()``.
  
$\quad 2$. Call candidate regions based on bin-level data across all replicates using 
   ``CallCandidates()``
   
$\quad 3$. Fit Negative binomial models for read counts in candidate regions to 
detect and rank peaks among all candidates using ``CallPeaks.multiRep()``.


If there is only one replicate, functions in step 2 
and step 3 will be replaced by 
one function ``CallPeaks.oneRep()``, while function ``DivideBins()`` 
will still be used to obtain bin-level data. Please see the man pages for
detailed usage of ``DivideBins()``. Given bin-level data, peak calling 
by sub-functions are included in following 
Section \@ref(section:PeakMultiReps) and Section \@ref(section:PeakOneRep).


## Peak calling with multiple replicates {#section:PeakMultiReps}
### Obtain candidate regions
With bin-level read counts, binomial test is first conducted 
for each bin. Then an ad hoc bump-finding algorithm 
is applied to merge significant bins 
(and/or bins with large fold change) and form bumps in each replicate. 
Bumps from all input \& IP replicates are unioned together to 
construct a list of candidate regions. 
Both binomial tests and bump-finding are done by 
function ``CallCandidates()`` in TRESS. 

Here, we use example dataset ``Basal`` introduced in Section \@ref(section:EData) to run ``CallCandidates()``.
```{r,eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## load in first example dataset
data("Basal") 
Candidates = CallCandidates(
    Counts = Basal$Bins$Counts,
    bins = Basal$Bins$Bins
    )
```


### Call peaks from candidates
After obtaining candidate regions, TRESS models read counts 
in candidate regions using a hierarchical negative-binomial model. 
Wald tests are then conducted to detect significant regions 
from candidates, where a region with methylation level significantly higher than the background is considered as sigificant. 
The background methylation level is estimated based on 
total read counts 
from non-candidate regions, which is calculated as the total 
bin-counts subtracted by counts from candidate regions. 
This can be obtained using function ``BgMethylevel()`` in TRESS.
With background methylation level estimated, 
complete parameter estimation and statistical inference 
for candidate regions are achieved by function 
``CallPeaks.multiRep()`` in TRESS, where argument ``Candidates`` 
is a list containing at least two components: genomic coordinates 
(e.g., "chr", "start" and "end" etc) of all candidate regions 
and their read counts across all samples. 
Here is an example, provided that the background 
methylation level is 0.5,
```{r, eval=FALSE, message= TRUE, warning= FALSE}
data("Basal") ### load candidate regions
Basal$Candidates$sf = Basal$Bins$sf
peaks1 = CallPeaks.multiRep(
  Candidates = Basal$Candidates,
  mu.cutoff = 0.5
  )
head(peaks1, 3)
```
_**A word about CallPeaks.multiRep()**_ 
Different criteria are available in TRESS to filter peaks based on results of Wald tests, including p-values, FDR and 
log fold change (logFC). 
One needs to first specify a criterion through argument  ``WhichThreshold`` and 
then provide a cutoff for that criterion 
through one or two arguments named ``*.cutoff``.
By default, TRESS adopts both FDR and 
logFC (through``WhichThreshold = "fdr_lfc"``) to select peaks. 
The default cutoffs for FDR and logFC are 0.05 and 0.7 
(for fold change of 2) respectively, meaning that peaks 
with FDR < 0.05 and logFC > 0.7 will be kept. 
With ``WhichThreshold = "fdr_lfc"``, one can 
change the cutoffs to more stringent values, 
e.g., FDR < 0.01 and logFC > 1.6 by setting 
``fdr.cutoff = 0.01`` and ``lfc.cutoff = 1.6``: 
```{r, eval=FALSE, message= TRUE, warning= FALSE}
### use different threshold to filter peaks
peaks2 = CallPeaks.multiRep(
  Candidates = Basal$Candidates,
  mu.cutoff = 0.5, 
  fdr.cutoff = 0.01, 
  lfc.cutoff = 1.6  
  )
```

However, one can also set ``WhichThreshold = "fdr"`` to select 
peaks only with FDR, then by default peaks 
with FDR < 0.05 will be kept: 
```{r, eval=FALSE, message= TRUE, warning= FALSE}
### use different threshold to filter peaks
peaks3 = CallPeaks.multiRep(
  Candidates = Basal$Candidates,
  mu.cutoff = 0.5, 
  WhichThreshold = "fdr"
  )
```
Please read the manual page of function ``CallPeaks.multiRep()`` 
for more details on each argument. 

Given the usage of function "CallPeaks.multiRep()", 
it can also be adopted to re-rank existing peaks with our 
developed methods, if their read counts are available. 
This may perform bad if one didn't properly 
estimate library size factor (one argument of ``Candidates``) 
for each sample. 
Based on our experience, the estimation of size factor 
should be based on the bin-level counts across the 
whole transcriptome, not the region-level counts. 
For background methylation level, 
one can use 0.5 but it would be informative if
estimating it from the data.


## Peak calling with one replicate {#section:PeakOneRep}
The above two-step approach is for data with multiple replicates. 
For data with only one replicate, ``TRESS_peak()`` calls function ``CallPeaks.oneRep()`` 
for peak calling given bin-level data. In this case, 
bumps in the only one replicate are taken as final list of peaks. 
The statistical significance of each peak comes from binomial tests. Here is an example of how to run function ``CallPeaks.oneRep()``.
```{r, eval = FALSE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
# A toy example
data("Basal")
bincounts = Basal$Bins$Counts[, 1:2]
sf0 = Basal$Bins$sf[1:2]
bins = Basal$Bins$Bins
peaks = CallPeaks.oneRep(Counts = bincounts, 
                         sf = sf0, bins = bins)
head(peaks, 3)
```


## Peak visualization 
With pre-called peaks in hand, one can visualize them 
using function "ShowOnePeak()" in TRESS. 
The usage of this function is
```{r, eval=FALSE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
ShowOnePeak(onePeak, allBins, binCounts, ext = 500, ylim = c(0,1))
```
In order to run this function, one needs to have: 
1) "onePeak": 
a pre-called peak saved as a dataframe, 
which contains genomic positions for that peak: 
"chr", "start", "end", "strand"; 
2) "allBins": genomic positions ("chr", "start", "end", "strand") 
of bins overlapping at least with the pre-called peak; 
3) "binCounts": the corresponding bin-level 
read counts in each replicate.
This function will plot for each replicate: 
the methylation level of bins (blue bars) within 
the target peak (shade region in pink), 
and the normalized sequencing depth for input samples (curves in grey).
We show some example plots here:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
peaks = read.table(file.path(system.file(package = "TRESS"),
                             "extdata/examplebyBam_peaks.xls"),
                   sep = "\t", header = TRUE) 
load(file.path(system.file(package = "TRESS"),
               "extdata/examplebyBam.rda"))
allBins = as.data.frame(bins$bins)
colnames(allBins)[1] = "chr"
allBins$strand = binStrand

head(peaks, 1)
ShowOnePeak(onePeak = peaks[1,], allBins = allBins, 
            binCounts = allCounts)
```



# Detection of transcriptome wide differential peaks {#section:DiffPeak}
Unlike peak calling which implements all steps in one function
``TRESS_peak()``, TRESS separates the model fitting, which is the most 
computationally heavy part, from the hypothesis testing. The model fitting is 
implemented by ``TRESS_DMRfit()`` while the hypothesis testing is implemented
by ``TRESS_DMRtest()``. Given an experimental design with multiple factors, 
the parameter estimation (model fitting) only 
needs to be performed once, and then the hypothesis 
testing for DMR calling can be performed for different 
factors efficiently. 

Given all required files, differential peak calling in TRESS can be done
through,
```{r, eval=FALSE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
InputDir = "/directory/to/BAMfile"
Input.file = c("input1.bam", "input2.bam",..., "inputN.bam")
IP.file = c("ip1.bam", "ip2.bam", ..., "ipN.bam")
OutputDir = "/directory/to/output"
Path_sqlit = "/path/to/xxx.sqlite"
variable = "YourVariable" # a dataframe containing both
# testing factor and potential covariates, 
# e.g., for a two-group comparison with balanced samples 
# variable = data.frame(Trt = rep(c("Ctrl", "Trt"), each = N/2))
model = "YourModel"     # e.g. model = ~1 + Trt
DMR.fit = TRESS_DMRfit(IP.file = IP.file,
                       Input.file = Input.file,
                       Path_To_AnnoSqlite = Path_sqlit,
                       variable = variable,
                       model = model,
                       InputDir = InputDir,
                       OutputDir = OutputDir,
                       experimentName = "xxx"
                       )
CoefName(DMR.fit)# show the name and order of coefficients 
                 # in the design matrix
Contrast = "YourContrast" # e.g., Contrast = c(0, 1)
DMR.test = TRESS_DMRtest(DMR = DMR.fit, contrast = Contrast)
```


Similar to ``TRESS_peak()``, ``TRESS_DMRfit()`` involves
multiple procedures for differential analysis:
 
$\quad 1$. Divide the whole genome into equal sized bins and obtain bin 
read counts for samples across all conditions using ``DivideBins()``

$\quad 2$. Loosely call candidate DMRs from samples across 
all conditions using ``CallCandidates()``. 

$\quad 3$. Model candidate DMRs using Negative binomial distribution and 
estimates all parameters for each candidate DMR, using 
``CallDMRs.paramEsti()``. 



## Divide genome and obtain candidate DMR regions
TRESS applies the same algorithm used in peak calling to call 
candidate DMRs, which is 
a union of candidate regions from group-specific samples. 
Given $N$ paired input and IP BAM files, 
candidate DMRs from all samples are obtained 
using:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
InputDir = "/directory/to/BAMfile"
Input.file = c("input1.bam", "input2.bam",..., "inputN.bam")
IP.file = c("ip1.bam", "ip2.bam", ..., "ipN.bam")
OutputDir = "/directory/to/output"
Path_sqlit = "/path/to/xxx.sqlite"
allBins = DivideBins(IP.file = IP.file,
                     Input.file = Input.file,
                     Path_To_AnnoSqlite = Path_sqlit,
                     InputDir = InputDir,
                     OutputDir = OutputDir,
                     experimentName = "example")
Candidates = CallCandidates(Counts = allBins$binCount, 
                            bins = allBins$bins)
Candidates = filterRegions(Candidates) 
```
As listed above, prior to DMR detection, TRESS filters out some 
candidates who have small 
marginal coefficient of variation in methylation ratio (
$\frac{\text{normalized } IP}{ \text{normalized } IP 
\text{ + }\text{normalized } input}$).
Similar to modeling transcriptome regions instead of bins, 
this pre-filtering step helps to 
reduce the hypothesis testing space and thus improves 
statistical power after multiple testing correction.


## Call DMRs from candidates
With candidate DMRs, TRESS fits hierarchical negative binomial 
models for read counts in them, where methylation 
level of each candidate DMR is connected 
to factors of interest using a linear frame work. 
The Negative binomial model fitting here consists 
of: (1) estimate coefficients in design matrix 
for each candidate DMR; 
(2) estimate dispersion of methylation for each candidate DMR; 

After model fitting, TRESS conducts Wald test for each candidate DMR. 
As mentioned earlier, the methylation level of each candidate
is linked to factors in a linear frame work. 
This characteristic allows for
testing all coefficients in the design and 
any linear combination of them through a particular contrast. 
Therefore, TRESS can be applied in studies 
only considering a two-group comparison and 
studies with a more complex design.


### Two-group comparison
Here, we use a human data ``DMR_M3vsWT`` as an example. 
As introduced in the second example dataset in 
Section \@ref(section:EData), it consists of 
read counts in candidate DMRs from
samples under two conditions: WT and M3-KO. 
There are two replicates of paired IP and input data for 
samples from each condition. Given candidate DMRs, 
the estimation of parameters in each candidate DMR 
can be done through:

```{r, eval= FALSE}
data("DMR_M3vsWT") # data from TRESS
head(DMR_M3vsWT$Counts, 3)
variable = data.frame(predictor = rep(c("WT", "M3"), c(2, 2)))
model = ~1+predictor
DMR.fit = CallDMRs.paramEsti(counts = DMR_M3vsWT$Counts,
                             sf = DMR_M3vsWT$sf,
                             variable = variable,
                             model = model)
```
Note, the sample order in above ``variable$predictor``
must be exactly the same as that in data matrix ``DMR_M3vsWT$Counts``.

To compare methylation levels between WT
and M3-KO samples, do,
```{r,eval= FALSE}
CoefName(DMR.fit) ## show variable name of each coefficient
DMR.test = TRESS_DMRtest(DMR = DMR.fit, contrast = c(0, 1))
DMR.test[which(DMR.test$padj < 0.05)[1:3], ]
```
The option ``contrast = c(0, 1)`` is equivalent to test 
coefficient $\beta^{predictorWT} = 0$.

Individual DMR can be visualized using function ``ShowOnePeak()``:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
data("DMR_M3vsWT")
snames = paste0(rep(c("WT_", "M3_"), each = 2), 
                rep(c("Replicate1", "Replicate2"), 2))
ShowOnePeak(onePeak = DMR_M3vsWT$Regions[1, ],
            allBins = DMR_M3vsWT$Bins,
            binCounts = DMR_M3vsWT$BinsCounts,
            isDMR = TRUE,
            Sname = snames)
```



### General experiment design
For data from experiments with a general design including multiple
factors, hypothesis testing can be performed for one, multiple, 
or any linear combination of the parameters.

Here, we use an example mouse brain data ``DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek`` 
as an example to 
illustrate how TRESS detects DMRs in a multifactor design. 
As mentioned in Section \@ref(section:EData), it contains
candidate read counts from two mouse brain regions 
(cortex and hypothalamus) at two time points (2-week-old and 6-week-old). 
Each sample contains two paired input and IP replicates. 

To fit TRESS on this data without considering the interaction 
between time and region, do,
```{r, eval = FALSE}
data("DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek")
variable = data.frame(time = rep(c("2wk", "6wk"), each = 4),
                    region = rep(rep(c("Cortex", "Hypothalamus"), 
                                       each = 2),2)
                    )
model = ~1 + time + region 
DMRfit = CallDMRs.paramEsti(counts = DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$Counts, 
                            sf = DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$sf,
                            variable = variable,
                            model = model)
```
Again, the sample order in ``variable$time`` and in
``variable$region`` must be exactly the same as that 
in data matrix ``DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$Counts``.

To test the whole time effect, do:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
CoefName(DMRfit)
DMRtest = TRESS_DMRtest(DMRfit, contrast = c(0, 1, 0))
idx = order(abs(DMRtest$stat), decreasing = TRUE)
DMRtest[idx[1:3], ]
DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$MeRatio[idx[1:3],]
```
Here, the reason we specify ``contrast = c(0, 1, 0)`` is that 
the second column of design 
matrix ``model.matrix( model, variable)`` corresponds to time.  
This contrast is equivalent to test the 
coefficient of time equal to 0, i.e., $\beta^{\text{time6wk}} = 0$.


If one considers the interaction between time and region and 
wants to test region-specific time effect, just include ``time*region`` into ``model`` and do,
```{r, eval = FALSE}
model.int = ~1+ time + region + time*region 
model.matrix( model.int, variable)
DMRfit.int = CallDMRs.paramEsti(
  counts = DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$Counts, 
  sf = DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$sf, 
  variable = variable,
  model = model.int
  )
```

Then, in cortex, DMRs caused by time effect can be obtained through:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
CoefName(DMRfit.int)
CTX.6vs2 = TRESS_DMRtest(DMRfit.int, contrast = c(0, 1, 0, 0))
idx = order(abs(CTX.6vs2$stat), decreasing = TRUE)
CTX.6vs2[idx[1:3], ]
DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$MeRatio[
  idx[1:3], 
  grepl("Cortex",colnames(DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$MeRatio))]
```


In hypothalamus, DMRs caused by time effect can be obtained through:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
HTH.6vs2 = TRESS_DMRtest(DMRfit.int, contrast = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
idx = order(abs(HTH.6vs2$stat), decreasing = TRUE)
HTH.6vs2[idx[1:3], ]
DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$MeRatio[
  idx[1:3], 
  grepl("Hypothalamus",colnames(DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$MeRatio))]
```

Detection of DMRs by interaction of time and region (meaning that 
the temporal difference in methylation of these DMRs changes spatially) 
can be done through:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
CTXvsHTH.6vs2 = TRESS_DMRtest(DMRfit.int, contrast = c(0, 0, 0, 1))
idx = order(abs(CTXvsHTH.6vs2$stat), decreasing = TRUE)
CTXvsHTH.6vs2[idx[1:3], ]
DMR_SixWeekvsTwoWeek$MeRatio[
  idx[1:3], c(1,2,5,6,3,4,7,8)]
```
